# Merit America Capstone Project - Video Game Statistics

## This is my capstone project for Merit America. We had choices on what we wanted to do, and I decided to work on my own case. Now I am a gamer and I wanted to do something that involved video games. So, I decided to look into the number of sales for individual video games sold throughout the years. When I mean years.... I mean decades.
